# StackPay

StackPay is a Bitcoin-native payment gateway on Stacks for `sBTC`, `STX`, and `USDCx`. It combines on-chain invoices and payment routes with a merchant-facing Next.js console, Supabase-backed metadata, hosted checkout pages, receipts, and webhook-driven notifications.

## Current MVP

The current working MVP supports:

- merchant profile setup tied to a Stacks wallet
- standard invoices created on-chain, then stored in Supabase after confirmation
- `MultiPay` payment links for reusable fixed-price or suggested-price checkout
- a universal QR route that accepts `sBTC`, `STX`, and `USDCx`
- hosted payment pages
- processor-based payment confirmation
- receipt PDF generation
- Hiro Chainhook ingestion for `invoice-paid`
- in-app notifications with toast + sound
- dashboard metrics from real merchant invoice/link data

## Architecture

StackPay currently uses:

- `apps/web`: Next.js 14 app router app, route handlers, merchant console, hosted checkout
- `Supabase`: off-chain source of truth for merchants, invoices, payment links, receipts, notifications, and activity
- `packages/contracts/stackpay`: Clarity contracts and tests
- `Stacks wallets`: merchant identity and contract signing

There is still an `apps/api` scaffold in the repo, but the active MVP backend now lives in Next.js route handlers under [`apps/web/app/api`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/app/api).

## Monorepo Structure

- [`apps/web`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web): web app, API routes, hosted payment surfaces
- [`apps/api`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/api): legacy API scaffold, not the active MVP backend
- [`packages/contracts/stackpay`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/packages/contracts/stackpay): Clarity contracts and tests
- [`packages/domain`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/packages/domain): shared business metadata
- [`packages/integrations`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/packages/integrations): integration/webhook manifests
- [`packages/sdk`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/packages/sdk): SDK scaffolding
- [`packages/ui`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/packages/ui): navigation metadata and shared UI config
- [`packages/config`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/packages/config): environment and network helpers
- [`supabase`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/supabase): Supabase config and migrations
- [`docs`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/docs): MVP notes, Chainhook config, integration docs

## Merchant Flows

### Standard invoice

1. Merchant completes profile setup.
2. Merchant creates a standard invoice from [`/create-invoice`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/app/(app)/create-invoice/page.tsx).
3. Wallet submits `architecture.create-invoice`.
4. Chain result returns the on-chain invoice id.
5. Only then does StackPay store the invoice in Supabase.
6. Customer pays from the hosted invoice page.
7. Payment confirmation creates a receipt and notification.

### MultiPay

`MultiPay` is a reusable public payment route.

- it does not expire like a standard invoice
- it uses one currency
- it supports either:
  - one fixed amount
  - up to 3 suggested amounts
- each customer payment generates a fresh on-chain invoice under the hood

Merchant management:

- create from [`/create-invoice`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/app/(app)/create-invoice/page.tsx)
- review all created MultiPay routes at [`/payment-links`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/app/(app)/payment-links/page.tsx)

### Universal QR

The universal QR route is a permanent public route for flexible real-world payments.

- customers choose asset
- customers choose amount
- the route remains stable
- managed from [`/qr-link`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/app/(app)/qr-link/page.tsx)

## On-Chain + Off-Chain Responsibilities

### On-chain

The `architecture` + `processor` contracts handle:

- canonical invoice ids
- public link ids
- invoice/payment state
- receipt ids
- `invoice-paid` events for Chainhooks

### Supabase

Supabase stores:

- merchant profiles
- settlement wallet metadata
- invoices and public links for dashboard/querying
- receipts
- activity events
- notifications
- chainhook delivery state

## Notification Pipeline

Current payment notifications work like this:

1. Hiro Chainhook watches the deployed StackPay `architecture` contract.
2. On `invoice-paid`, Hiro posts to [`/api/webhooks/chainhooks`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/app/api/webhooks/chainhooks/route.ts).
3. StackPay confirms the invoice/receipt in Supabase.
4. A notification row is inserted.
5. The header bell and toast update from [`NotificationsButton.tsx`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/components/app/NotificationsButton.tsx).

The sample upload file is:

- [`docs/stackpay-chainhook-invoice-paid.json`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/docs/stackpay-chainhook-invoice-paid.json)

Email notifications are not implemented yet. The current pipeline is in-app only.

## Receipts

Paid invoices can generate receipt PDFs through:

- [`/api/receipts/[receiptId]/pdf`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/app/api/receipts/[receiptId]/pdf/route.ts)
- PDF generator lives in [`receipt-pdf.ts`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/lib/server/receipt-pdf.ts)

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the web app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run contract tests:

```bash
npm run test:contracts
```

## Supabase Setup

### Local Supabase

Copy envs:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Start local Supabase:

```bash
npm run supabase:start
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
npm run supabase:db:reset
```

Stop local Supabase:

```bash
npm run supabase:stop
```

### Remote Supabase

Authenticate and link:

```bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

Push migrations:

```bash
npm run supabase:db:push
```

If you switch from local to remote, make sure your remote DB actually has the current unique constraints used by `upsert`, especially on:

- `merchant_profiles.wallet_address`
- `merchant_wallets.wallet_address`
- `invoices.onchain_invoice_id`
- `notifications.source_key`
- `chainhook_events.delivery_key`

## Required Environment Variables

See [`apps/web/.env.example`](/Users/sam/Desktop/Stacks/Stackpay/apps/web/.env.example).

Important values:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_NETWORK`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKPAY_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKPAY_PROCESSOR_CONTRACT_ID`
- `STACKPAY_CHAINHOOK_SECRET`
- `STACKPAY_STACKS_API_URL` (optional override)

## Key Routes

Merchant pages:

- `/dashboard`
- `/create-invoice`
- `/invoices`
- `/payment-links`
- `/qr-link`
- `/profile`

Hosted/public pages:

- `/pay/[invoiceId]`
- `/pay/link/[slug]`

Core API routes:

- `GET /api/merchant/profile`
- `POST /api/merchant/profile`
- `GET /api/invoices`
- `POST /api/invoices`
- `POST /api/invoices/confirm`
- `GET /api/payment-links`
- `POST /api/payment-links`
- `POST /api/payment-links/[paymentLinkId]/chain`
- `GET /api/payment-links/public/[slug]`
- `POST /api/payment-links/public/[slug]/invoices`
- `POST /api/payment-links/public/[slug]/invoices/confirm`
- `GET /api/qr-link`
- `POST /api/qr-link`
- `GET /api/notifications`
- `PATCH /api/notifications`
- `POST /api/webhooks/chainhooks`

## Notes

- The hosted merchant “open” actions now open in a new tab where appropriate.
- Recent dashboard activity is deduped server-side so a single invoice/link does not spam the feed.
- Notification sound is browser-dependent. Browsers may require prior user interaction before audio can play.
